<p align="justify">
Autonomous agents is a well-established area that has been researched for decades, both from a design and implementation viewpoint.  Nonetheless, the application of agents in real world scenarios is largely adopted when logical distribution is needed, while still limited when physical distribution is necessary.
In parallel, robots are no longer used only in industrial applications, but are instead being applied to an increasing number of domains, ranging from robotic assistants to search and rescue. Robots in these applications often benefit from (or require) some level (semi or full) of autonomy. Thus, multi-agent solutions can be exploited in robotic scenarios, considering their strong similarity both in terms of logical distribution and interaction among autonomous entities.<br>
<br>
The autonomous behaviour responsible for decision-making should (ideally) be verifiable since these systems are expensive to produce and are often deployed in safety-critical situations. Thus, verification and validation are important and necessary steps towards providing assurances about the reliability of autonomy in these systems.
This workshop aims to bring together researchers from the autonomous agents and the robotics communities, as combining knowledge coming from these two research areas may lead to innovative approaches that solve complex problems related with the verification and validation of autonomous robotic systems. Consequently, we encourage submissions that combine agents, robots, and verification, but we also welcome papers focused on one of these areas, as long as their applicability to the other areas is clear.

## Workshop format

<p align="justify">
This event is planned as a one-day workshop. Our aim is to have three reviews per paper. At least one of the authors of an accepted paper should attend the workshop to present their work. Depending on the number of submissions, we would like to have a discussion panel at the end. We also expect to have at least one invited talk, focused on autonomous decision-making with agents applied to robotic systems.
