The Autonomy and Verification Laboratory is involved in three Robotics and Artificial Intelligence hubs. Each hub focusses on autonomous robotics in a different hazardous environment: the [RAIN Hub](http://rainhub.org.uk/) in nuclear robotics, the [ORCA Hub](https://orcahub.org/) in robotics offshore , and the [FAIR-SPACE Hub](https://www.fairspacehub.org/) in robots in space.
