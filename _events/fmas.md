title: "Formal Methods for Autonomous Systems Workshop"

## Workshop at [FM 2019](http://formalmethods2019.inesctec.pt/)

Futuristic robotic systems are autonomous, intelligent, physical entities that interact with and can
influence the real world. These systems can be viewed under a number of headings including cyber-physical, hybrid,
real-time, etc. When deployed in the real world these systems are inherently safety-critical and thus must be formally verified
for both certification purposes and in order to obtain public trust. Furthermore, there are many technical issues related
to the formal verification of critical, AI controlled robotic systems including the formal verification of the autonomous part
of the system and correctly modelling the physical environment within which the robot is operating, to name but a few.
The goals of this workshop are to bring together leading researchers in this area to present recent and ongoing work, including
experience reports and case studies as well as identify future directions for this emerging application of formal methods.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers working on a range of techniques for formal verification of autonomous systems, to present recent work in the area, discuss key difficulties, and stimulate collaboration between the robotics and formal methods communities. The workshop will include invited speakers, contributed papers, experience reports, and demonstrations.

## Submissions

Submission will be via [easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmas2019), in LNCS format.

We will accept two categories of submission:
* Short papers: 6 pages LNCS, and
* long papers: 15 pages LNCS.

Submissions will receive at least three, single-blind reviews. If a paper is accepted, at least one of the authors must attend the workshop to present their work.
