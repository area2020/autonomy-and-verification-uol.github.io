title: "Home Robot Lab"
---

The Home Robot Lab is intended to emulate the internals of a house, in which robots can be deployed and developed for use in domestic/social care. It comprises several Pepper, NAO, and Miro robots, all within a Vicon tracked space. The Lab includes furniture to partially simulate a domestic environment and supports and facilitates leading-edge collaborative research across: Human-Robot Interaction & Social Robotics, Verification & Validation, Legality & Certification, Dependability & Trust, Privacy & Security, and Ethics. This is derived from successful EPSRC research projects on domestic/social robotics, for example [www.robosafe.org]()
