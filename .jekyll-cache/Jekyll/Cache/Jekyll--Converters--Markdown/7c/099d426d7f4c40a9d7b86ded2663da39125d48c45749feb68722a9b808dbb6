<p><img alt="FMAS Workshop Logo" style="float: left; margin: 1em" src="https://autonomy-and-verification-uol.github.io/images/logos/FMAS-Logo.png" /></p>

<p>This one day workshop will bring together researchers working on a range of techniques for formal verification of autonomous systems,
to present recent work in the area, discuss key difficulties, and stimulate collaboration between the robotics and formal methods
communities. This workshop will include invited speakers, contributed papers, experience reports, and a discussion panel.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>Autonomous â€“ and Robotic â€“ Systems present unique challenges for formal methods. They are embodied entities that can interact with
the real world and make autonomous decisions. Amongst others, they can be viewed as safety-critical, cyber-physical, hybrid, and real-time systems.
Key issues for formal methods applied to autonomous systems include capturing how the system will deal with a dynamic external environment
and verification of the systemâ€™s decision making capabilities â€“ including planning, ethical, and reconfiguration choices. Some autonomous
systems require certification before deployment, others require public trust for wide adoption; both of these scenarios are being tackled
by formal methods.</p>

<p>The goals of this workshop are to bring together leading researchers in this area to present recent and ongoing work, including
experience reports and case studies as well as identify future directions for this emerging application of formal methods.
This workshop is concerned with the use of formal methods to specify, model, or verify autonomous or robotic systems; in whole or in part.
Submissions may focus on case studies that identify the challenges for formal methods in this area, or experience reports that provide guidelines
for tackling these challenges. Work using integrated formal methods, or describing the future directions of this field, are particularly welcome.</p>

<h2 id="programme-information">Programme Information</h2>

<p>The workshop will feature invited speakers and presentations of accepted papers. The workshop will also feature a discussion panel for a structured, whole-group conversation for scoping the future directions of formal methods for autonomous systems.</p>

<li> <b> Title </b> : <span class="talk-title">Formal Methods Meet Autonomous Systems:a Journey on a Two-Year Research Collaboration with Industry </span> </li>
<li> <b> Abstract </b> : Autonomous - and Robotic - Systems are systems made up of collaborating computational elements, interacting and adapting to the physical environment and  making  autonomous  decisions.  Formal  methods  provide  mathematically-based  techniques  for  the  specification  and  development  of  software  and  hard-ware systems. The adoption of formal methods by the industry developing autonomous and robotic systems is, however, still slow.This talk reports on a two-year research collaboration with industry focused on applying formal method techniques in the development of autonomous systems. First, it discusses the main challenges and results achieved in the definition of specification patterns for robotic missions, a project in collaboration with PAL Robotics and BOSCH. Mission specification patterns provide logic-based solutions for recurrent specification problems where developers have to define the desired behaviour of a robotic application (a.k.a missions). Then,it discusses a procedure for generating online test oracles from logic-based formulations  of  functional  requirements  of  autonomous  systems,  a  project  in collaboration with Luxspace and QRA Corp. The procedure addresses a set of real-world challenges related to autonomous systems and has been evaluated on a real-world satellite system model. Finally, the talk presents a set of challenges and opportunities that emerged from the two-year journey of collaboration with industry </li>

<li> <b>Title</b> : <span class="talk-title"> Runtime Reasoning that Really Flies </span> </li>
<li> <b>Abstract</b>: Real-time, on-board runtime reasoning about system safety and security is required for autonomous systems, including most everything that flies: aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and the robotic systems therein. The field of runtime verification (RV) is vast, and quickly growing, yet when it comes to real-life autonomous systems, current RV capabilities just don't fly. There is a dearth of RV tools that can operate within the constraints of real-life embedded operations that limit the system instrumentation, space, timing, power, weight, cost, operating conditions, and other resources. Even when we devise tools for embedded operation, RV must first clear the tall hurdles of input specifications, validation, verification, and flight certification. We highlight case studies where RV has recently risen to the occasion of reasoning on-board real-life autonomous systems, such as Unmanned Aerial Systems and NASA's Robonaut2, and examine the way up from here. What will it take for RV to really take off?</li>

</ul>
<ul class="paper-details">
<li> <b>Authors:</b> Keith Clark, <a href="http://brijeshdongol.github.io">Brijesh Dongol</a>, and Peter Robinson. </li>
<li> <b>Abstract: </b>Teleo-Reactive (TR) procedures are a robotic agent programming language proposed by Nils Nilsson. Each parameterised procedure comprises a sequence of guarded action rules where the guards of later rules are sub-goals of the guard of the first rule. We informally describe the evaluation semantics of a TR procedure call. We then formalise the concept of a TR procedure call evaluation by expressing key properties in LTL. Finally we show how the LTL statements can be used to prove key properties of a simple TR program making use of assumptions about the correspondence between the agentâ€™s Belief Store percept facts and properties of the perceived world, and between the agentâ€™s actions and environment change.

<b>Abstract: </b>Nowadays, autonomous crossing manoeuvres at intersections are especially challenging. In related work, a crossing controller for provably safe autonomous urban traffic manoeuvres was introduced. We extend this controller by a decentralised scheduling mechanism that ensures fair behaviour of the controller and also guarantees bounded liveness. We verify the correctness of our extension by an implementation and analysis with UPPAAL Stratego.

</ul>
<ul class="paper-details">
<li> <b>Authors:</b> Andreas Nonnengart, Matthias Klusch, and Christian Mueller </li>
<li> <b>Abstract: </b>Ensuring pedestrian-safety is paramount to the acceptance
and success of autonomous cars. The scenario-based training and testing
of such self-driving vehicles in virtual driving simulation environments
increasingly gained attention in the past years. Key challenge is the automated generation of critical traffic scenarios which usually are rare in
real-world traffic, while computing and testing all possible scenarios is
infeasible in practice. In this paper, we present a formal method-based
approach CriSGen for an automated and complete generation of critical
traffic scenarios for virtual training of self-driving cars. These scenarios
are determined as close variants of given but uncritical and formally abstracted scenarios via reasoning on their non-linear arithmetic constraint formulas, such that the original maneuver of the self-driving car in them will not be pedestrian-safe anymore, enforcing it to further adapt the behavior during training. </li>

</ul>
<ul class="paper-details">
<li> <b>Authors:</b> Louis Viard, Laurent Ciarletta and Pierre-Etienne Moreau </li>
<li> <b>Abstract: </b>Safe operation of Cyber-Physical Systems such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems requires guarantees not only on the system, but also on the mission. Following approaches that are used to produce robust Cyber-Physical Controllers, we present the architecture of a mission definition, verification and validation toolchain. We conclude by reporting on the current state of the authors' implementation of this framework.</li>

<li> <b>Abstract: </b>The design of autonomous vehicles includes obstacle detection and avoidance, route planning, speed control, etc. However, there is a gap considering how the rules of the road should be represented in an autonomous vehicle. Additionally, it is necessary to understand the behaviour of autonomous systems in order to check whether or not they work according to the rules of the road. Here, we propose a model checking agent-based architecture to embed the rules of the road in an agent representing the behaviour of an autonomous vehicle. </li>
