<p>Cyber security is a key concern within most complex, communicating systems particularly cyber-physical systems that may involve robotics, autonomy, and/or machine-learning. Currently these kinds of systems are under-represented in space deployments. However, recent advancements in the development of such systems indicates that future space missions will inevitably deploy robotics, autonomy, and machine-learning in a much more fundamental way. Due to the communicating nature of these systems, cyber security considerations should play a central role in the design and development of future space research and missions.</p>

<p>We will bring leading companies tackling the development of future space technologies together with academic experts from the FAIR-SPACE Hub to discuss security in order to scope out research priorities and to develop collaborative R&amp;D programmes on the topic of cyber security between FAIR-SPACE and industrial partners.</p>

<p>Full details are available on the <a href="http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~marie/scopingsecwk/" target="_blank">Space Security Scoping Workshop</a> website.
