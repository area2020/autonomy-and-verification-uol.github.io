I"<p>The Autonomy and Verification Laboratory is involved in three Robotics and Artificial Intelligence hubs. Each hub focusses on autonomous robotics in a different hazardous environment:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://rainhub.org.uk/">RAIN Hub</a> for nuclear robotics,</li>
  <li><a href="https://orcahub.org/">ORCA Hub</a> for offshore robotics, and</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.fairspacehub.org/">FAIR-SPACE Hub</a> for space robotics.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can view our <a href="#rai-hubs-publications">publications</a> on these three hubs, below; and you can keep track of our tweets about the hubs at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=HazardousHubs"> <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i> #HazardousHubs</a></p>

<p>The research hubs are funded by the <a href="https://www.ukri.org/innovation/industrial-strategy-challenge-fund/">UK Research and Innovation Industrial Strategy</a>, which aims to link academia and industry to tackle societal and industrial challenges. The specific <a href="https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/calls/raihubs/">aim</a> of the RAI hubs is to “develop robotic solutions to make a safer working environment” for industries like off-shore energy, nuclear energy, and space. Crucially, this requires cross-disciplinary research, which is why each hub has a variety of academic and industrial partners.</p>

<p>Each of these environments might be dull or dirty; and the environments themselves are often dangerous or distant. Dull jobs lead to mistakes; dangerous and dirty jobs are harmful to humans or the environment; and distant jobs make remote control tricky or impossible. Increasing the autonomy of robots in these environments, and the environments themselves, provide challenges for our research; which is generally focussed on verification of the safety of these robotic systems.</p>

<p>Most of our work for the RAI hubs is relevant across all three hubs. Examples of our active strands of work on the RAI hubs include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verifiable, <strong>explainable</strong> autonomous systems;</li>
  <li>Verification of robot plans and reconfigurations;</li>
  <li>Verifiable runtime monitoring of safety properties;</li>
  <li>Linking the verification of heterogeneously specified components;</li>
  <li>Planning around unseen hazards, such as wind;</li>
  <li>Ensuring verification evidence is suitable for certification.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Robotics and AI In Nuclear (RAIN) Hub aims to tackle the challenges of increasing the level of autonomy of robotic systems within the UK’s civilian nuclear industry.</p>

<p>Major challenges:</p>
<ul style="overflow:auto; padding:0 0 0 2em;">
<li> Radiation restricts human intervention, hardware choices, and sensors;</li>
<li> Radiation also presents an invisible hazard; and,</li>
<li> The nuclear industry has needfully strict certification requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="offshore-robotics-for-certification-of-assets">Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets</h3>

<p><a href="https://orcahub.org/"> <img alt="ORCA Logo" style="float: left; margin: 1em" src="https://autonomy-and-verification-uol.github.io/images/logos/orca-logo.png" /></a></p>

<p>The Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets (ORCA) Hub aims to enable autonomous robotic systems for inspecting offshore assets, such as wind turbines and oil rigs.</p>

<p>Major Challenges:</p>
<ul style="overflow:auto; padding:0 0 0 2em;">
<li> The robotic system's environment, such as the wind and sea state, can change rapidly;</li>
<li> Wind and sea can also pose invisible, or hard to detect, hazards;</li>
<li> Hazardous environment also restricts human intervention.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.fairspacehub.org/"> <img alt="FAIR Space Logo" style="float: left; margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 2em" src="https://autonomy-and-verification-uol.github.io/images/logos/fair-space-b-logo.png" /></a></p>

<p>The Future AI and Robotics for Space (FAIR Space) Hub aims to develop autonomous robotic systems for use in space exploration.</p>

<p>Major Challenges:</p>
<ul style="overflow:auto; padding:0 0 0 2em;">
<li> Robots are so remote that human intervention is impossible;</li>
<li> Distance also causes a communications delay;</li>
<li> Robotic systems designed for remote access are vulnerable to security threats.</li>
</ul>
