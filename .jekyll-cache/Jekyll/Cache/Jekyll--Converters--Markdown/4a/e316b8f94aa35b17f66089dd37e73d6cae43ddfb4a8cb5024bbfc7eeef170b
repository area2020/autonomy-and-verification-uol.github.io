<p>The Verifiable Autonomy project is an EPSRC-funded collaboration between Computer Science researchers at the University of Liverpool, Roboticists at the University of the West of England and Control Scientists at the University of Sheffield.</p>

<p>The project aims to tackle the challenges of robotic systems that can make their own decisions, without direct human intervention. The labâ€™s work on this project involves extending existing program model-checking techniques for BDI-style agents, especially where this involves checking legal or ethical requirements.</p>
