<p>The Reconfigurable Autonomy project is an EPSRC-funded collaboration between Computer Science researchers at the University of Liverpool, Autonomous Control Systems and Astronautics researchers at the University of Southampton and Spacecraft Autonomy researchers at Surrey Space centre. The projects aim to provide a rational agent architecture that controls autonomous decision-making, is re-usable and generic, and can be configured for many different autonomous platforms.</p>
